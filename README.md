# RPS-Multiplayer

### Multi-player Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Instructions:
* Each user should open their own sperate page in a browser
* There can only be two players at a given time
* enter your name and click "start" to begin
* if you are the only player, you will have to wait for a second player to join
* once both players are signed on, you will begin the game
* choose either rock, paper, or scissors. Depending on the other user's choice, you will win, lose or tie
* the webpage will display the result of the round and tally wins and losses (ties are not counted for now)
* feel free to message the other user with the message board at the bottom of the page

### Notes
* code is really long, verbose, and redundant. I have not had a chance to go through and clean it up
* message board does not delete old messages for a user who stays on while the other person leaves
* eventually I would like to change the struture so that each user can chose at the same time, instead of using a turn based format
